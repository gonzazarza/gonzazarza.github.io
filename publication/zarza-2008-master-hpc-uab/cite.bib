 abstract = {The intensive and continous use of high-performance computers to execute computationally intensive applications, coupled with the large number of elements that make them up, dramatically increase the likelihood of failures during their operation. This works focuses on solving the problem of fault tolerance for high speed interconnection networks by means of designing fault tolerant routing policies. The goal is to solve a determined number of link and node failures, considering its impact factor and occurrence probability. To acomplish this task we take advantage of the communication path redundancy, through adaptive routing approaches that fulfils with the four phases of the fault tolerance: error detection, damage confinement and assessment, error recovery, fault treatment and continuous service. The experiments shows performance's degradation under 5%. In the future, we'll treat the loose of information in transit.},
