 abstract = {The increase of link speeds in the interconnection networks is evident both inside and outside of a datacenter. Thus it contributes an increasing portion of the power budget of the interconnection system. Link power management has been receiving more attention and many mechanisms were proposed. The emerging bit-serial link technology allows the links to work with different numbers of lanes & speeds. When the traffic load is slight, links are put in low-speed mode and consume less energy. However, links working in the low speed mode result in the increase in serialization latency. We propose a routing algorithm that takes into account the history usage of the links to focus network traffic in a small subset of high-speed links. It keeps high-speed links busier and leaves low-speed links with more idle time. Thus the mechanism saves energy and reduces the incurred serialization latency.},
