Thus it contributes an increasing portion of the power budget of the interconnection system. Link power management has been receiving more attention and many mechanisms were proposed. The emerging bit-serial link technology allows the links to work with different numbers of lanes \u0026 speeds. When the traffic load is slight, links are put in low-speed mode and consume less energy. However, links working in the low speed mode result in the increase in serialization latency. We propose a routing algorithm that takes into account the history usage of the links to focus network traffic in a small subset of high-speed links. It keeps high-speed links busier and leaves low-speed links with more idle time. Thus the mechanism saves energy and reduces the incurred serialization latency.","tags":["energy saving","history-aware","routing algorithm","interconnection networks"],"title":"History-Aware Adaptive Routing Algorithm For Energy Saving in Interconnection Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gonzalo Zarza","Diego Lugones","Daniel Franco","Emilio Luque"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"bb79ff1e8e678cf92b7fc0d3338904b0","permalink":"https://www.gonzalozarza.me/publication/zarza-2012-iccs/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T22:15:57.176208Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zarza-2012-iccs/","section":"publication","summary":"Nowadays, the study of high-performance computing (HPC) is one of the essential aspects of postgraduate pro-grammes in Computational Science.

In this thesis we present fault-tolerant routing policies based on concepts of adaptability and deadlock freedom, capable of serving interconnection networks affected by a large number of link failures. Two contributions are presented throughout this thesis, namely: a multipath fault-tolerant routing method, and a novel and scalable deadlock avoidance technique. The first contribution of this thesis is the adaptive multipath routing method Fault-tolerant Distributed Routing Balancing (FT-DRB). This method has been designed to exploit the communication path redundancy available in many network topologies, allowing interconnection networks to perform in the presence of a large number of faults. The second contribution is the scalable deadlock avoidance technique Non-blocking Adaptive Cycles (NAC), specifically designed for interconnection networks suffering from a large number of failures. This technique has been designed and implemented with the aim of ensuring freedom from deadlocks in the proposed fault-tolerant routing method FT-DRB.","tags":["Networks; Fault tolerance; Routing"],"title":"Multipath Fault-tolerant Routing Policies to deal with Dynamic Link Failures in High Speed Interconnection Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

To acomplish this task we take advantage of the communication path redundancy, through adaptive routing approaches that fulfils with the four phases of the fault tolerance: error detection, damage confinement and assessment, error recovery, fault treatment and continuous service. The experiments shows performance's degradation under 5%. In the future, we'll treat the loose of information in transit.","tags":null,"title":"Políticas de encaminamiento tolerantes a fallos","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gonzalo Zarza","Hugo Minni"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1177977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1177977600,"objectID":"4086b2453b124e291f4534270be59af4","permalink":"https://www.gonzalozarza.me/publication/zarza-2007-wicc/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T22:15:57.170891Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zarza-2007-wicc/","section":"publication","summary":"El objetivo principal de este trabajo es desarrollar un enfoque práctico para la generación dinámica de interfaces de usuario a partir de modelos basados en esquemas XML, de acuerdo a las especificaciones W3C XML Schema Structures and Datatypes.

In addition, it produces effort duplication and misuse of resources. As a possible solution, this work proposes Learning Objects and Knowledge Repositories to be used. The authors state some design criteria for developing a web-enabled Learning Object Repository, according to the IEEE Learning Object Metadata standard. This repository would be used in a university educational context, replacing the disjointed procedures that are currently employed. Not only knowledge, but also human resources are the main entities in this proposal. Interoperability, portability and efficiency are the non-functional requirements considered at this design stage. In order to satisfy all of requirements, the combined usage of standard-compliant file-repositories and a relational database is proposed. The data consistence between these storage methods is assured by a specific mechanism delineated with this intention; in addition, some intuitive operators are defined for the specification of search criteria in arbitrary metadata queries.","tags":["Education Informatics","Learning Objects","Databases","Web Systems","Software Engineering"],"title":"Design Criteria For The Development Of An Institutional Learning Object Repository","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Javier Godoy","Gonzalo Zarza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1159660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1159660800,"objectID":"7bbe764e608d2403a43c824cf890c6ff","permalink":"https://www.gonzalozarza.me/publication/godoy-2006-eji/","publishdate":"2020-03-16T22:15:57.167778Z","relpermalink":"/publication/godoy-2006-eji/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Diseño de un Repositorio Institucional de Objetos de Aprendizaje Reutilizables","type":"publication"}]
